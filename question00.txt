Hooray, we're going to do a thing!

We'll go through this exercise together, and afterwards you will be friends with pipes. GOOD FRIENDS
with pipes.

You're on a mission to find the folder that matches the following criteria:
(Remember, always look in the puzzle0 folder.)

* The folder name should have an uppercase k in it
* The folder name has the numbers 607 in it
* The folder name either has an upper or lowercase b in it
* The folder name does not have Bass in it
* The folder name has FLX in it

Go to that folder and find the rtf file with the longest number of lines, 
and you will find your next clue in the last 30 lines.

(If you're feeling fancy, you could figure out how to go straight to the folder that 
matches all of those criteria.)
