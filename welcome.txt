Greetings!

Welcome to the command line maze! I'm hoping that you'll find these puzzles far more
entertaining than listening to me ramble on about various commands. I hope that this 
will encourage you to test things out, and use some creative problem-solving to figure 
out where to go next.

If you're reading this on Github.com, you'll need to clone the repository and start
from there. Open up a Terminal window, or a Git-Bash window, and navigate to the Desktop
by issuing the following commands:

`cd ~/Desktop`

Now, clone the repository by issuing the following additional commands:

`git clone https://github.com/dd388/command-line-maze`

Go into the repository:

`cd command-line-maze`

Open up the file `question00.txt` in whatever text editor you desire, and let's start
exploring!
