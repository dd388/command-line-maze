
The next bit might seem tricky, so stay with me. You can do this.

Find the number of files named 15.doc, and there is no specific folder name pattern
you are looking for.

Count the number of words in each of those files. You can use a loop if you're feeling loopy.

It might be an interesting challenge! But you don't have to if you don't want to.
